# Contributing

## License

Apache-2.0 (`LICENSE`).

## DCO

Every commit signs off the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):

```bash
git commit -s
```

Commits without a `Signed-off-by` trailer are not accepted.

## Conventional commits

Commit subjects and the PR title follow [Conventional Commits 1.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(scope)!: <description>
```

`type` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`,
`build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`, `bump`. `scope` and `!` (breaking change) are
optional. A space separates the colon from the description.

```
feat: add fibonacci C ABI
fix(c_api): clamp negative index instead of raising
docs: clarify clone map
feat(core)!: drop the old accumulator API
```

The `commitizen` CI job blocks the PR if any non-merge commit — or the PR
title — does not match. The title matters because a squash-merge folds the
whole PR into one commit whose subject is the title.

## Workflow

1. Branch from `main`, one logical change per commit.
2. Pass the gates: `nimble testAll`, `nimble pyTest`.
3. Open a PR; CI runs the 3-OS Nim matrix + C ABI + Python.

## Pre-commit

The CI gates also run locally via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com):

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

`pre-commit install` sets up the pre-commit, pre-push and commit-msg hooks at
once. Hooks: hygiene (trailing whitespace, EOF, yaml/toml, large files),
`nimble lint` on `*.nim`, `nimble checkVGraph` before push, Conventional Commits
via `cz check` on the commit message, and a DCO sign-off check. Run everything
manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Conventions

See `ADRs/0004` and `CLAUDE.md`. English comments, terse, describe what is done.
NimContracts compiled away under `-d:release`; the C ABI clamps, never raises.
